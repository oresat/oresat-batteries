# OreSat Battery Card v1.0The OreSat Power Domain (OPD) is designed with modularity and redundancy.  We are confident that our system will behave spectacularly in flight; we'll let you know after first flight if that is spectacularly well or spectacularly badly!## OreSat VbusOreSat main power bus is just our 2S Li Ion battery pack, which we've defined as 6.0 V minimum, 7.2 V typical, and 8.4 V maximum. Everything is directly connected to that bus, including:- Other Oreat battery cards. For >= 2U CubeSats, you'll probably have at least two battery cards.- All solar panels. Thus the solar panels see the direct battery voltage and can dump directly into the battery packs, thus doing _actual_ MPPT.- All loads.## Battery Card TopologyConfusingly, Each OreSat battery card has 2 independenet battery packs on it. Each pack is made of a 2S1P 18650 LiPo cell pack. So it's a 2x2S1P if you will. Despite this, each card is independent and the OPD is fully capable of functioning with only one active card.We decided to separate the packs instead of combining them into a single 2S2P pack for the sake of redundancy, we can lose one cell and the other pack can still provide power to the OPD, as opposed to losing an entire card from a single cell failure.  This design does come with the added drawbacks of extra overhead in the form of requiring more charge protection and fuel gauge circuitry.## Charge/Discharge ProtectionWe are using Ablic S8209 to monitor our cell voltage levels and disable charging if the cell voltage goes above the predetermined overcharging threshold or disable discharging if the cell voltage goes below a predetermined discharging threshold.  The S8209 has two inputs that, if activated, will trigger the either the over-charge or under-charge protection to activate.  This allows us to daisy chain these chips together, so that each cell has its own charge protection IC.  It also allows us to connect them to a GPIO on an onboard microcontroller so that we can manually disable charging or discharging functionality if needed.  Below is a state diagram that depicts the desired behavior of our charging and discharging protection circuit![Battery Disable State Diagram](https://github.com/oresat/oresat-batteries/blob/master/docs/OreSat%20Battery%20State%20Diagram.png)The output of the S8209 uses an internal N-channel MOSFET, which has the potential to latch from radiation exposure.   To combat this, we have P-channel MOSFETS in series with the VDD of each S8209, the gate of the MOSFET is connected to our onboard microcontroller, so that we can periodically power cycle the S8209 and clear the N-channel latch.  The actual control of charge and discharge are done using Linear LTC4412 ideal diode controllers. Totally bizarre, but indepdenently controllable!## Fuel Gauge and Cell Health MonitoringEach 2S1P battery back will have two MAX17205 fuel gauges to monitor the packs current state of charge, and the long term health of the battery.  Each MAX17205 will be reporting both the direct State of charge (in mAh) and the percentage over I2C to our M0, compensating for factors such as cell degradation and temperature ranges.  We are still testing the accuracy of the MAX17205's compensation algorithm's for extreme charge levels and temperature in our lab.  At this point we don't know how much we should be relying on these compensation algorithms, they could be amazing! Or horrible! We don't know! Yay science!Each fuel gauge is also monitoring the battery temperatures with a single internal sensor and two external thermistors (we are still determining the best position for these thermistors).  This gives us a wackton of data which is good because we are data hoarders.Finally the MAX17205 also does cell balancing, which we'll enable while charging.## HeatersThermal models of both 1U and 2U CubeSats show an average "passive" battery temperature of ~ - 10 C). That's not good. We can't charge the battery below 0 C. So we've added heaters to heat up the batteries when charging if necessary.We're using two Minco HK6903 heaters in parallel. They have "vacuum OK" (apparently?) urethane PSA that we'll use to attach them to the batteries. Note that they're 12.7 x 100 mm, and each heater goes across both batteries. at 49 ohms each, that's 25 ohms in parallel.- At 8.4V that's 2.8 W (at 100% DC)- At 6.0V that's 1.4 W (at 100% DC)- We can of course PWM them and reduce the W as necessaryUnclear on the heater's tempco or tolerance. We'll ignore for now.The heaters will draw 240 - 336 mA in normal operation. This means we're going to need to modify the OPD circuit breaker to allow more current.## Batteries- Tenergy model "30005-0 (ICR 18650-2600, LR1865SK)"- Rated at 2600 mAh- Max voltage: 4.2 V- Typical voltage: 3.6 V- Minimum voltage: 2.75 V- Maximum charge current: 1.25 A   - 0 - 45 C only- Maximum discharge Current:   - -20 - 5 C = 1.25 A   -  5 - 45 C = 5 A   - 45 - 60 C = 3.75 A ### TemperatureJust to summarize the battery temperature operational range:- Cell temperature < -20 C -- DEAD- Cell temperature < 0 C -- DISCHARGE ONLY- Cell temperature < 45 C -- NORMAL OPERATION- Cell temperature > 45 C-- DISCHARGE ONLY- Cell temperature > 60 C-- DEAD### Cell failure (short)- Short will plummet battery to < 2.5V (Vlvco) and S-8209 will disconnect the battery from discharging but not charging## Battery pack behaviors (circuitry + firmware)- Automatic discharge if > 6.0 V- Automatic slow charge if < 8.4 V- Fast charge if battery pack within ~ 0.5 V of other batteries## Hacking the OPD Circuit BreakerThe OPD circuit breaker is supposed to trip at 300 mA without any division at the current output. Since the headers could pull up to 336, we need to probably go up to that plus 50 mA. So we put in a 10K and 20K to make a 0.66 divider and an N CH MOSFET to turn on the divider on the signal "MOARPWR". Asserting MOARPWR should give you up to 400 mA.
